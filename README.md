GitHub Contributors
===================

This is little [Angular.js](http://angularjs.org/) app.

It uses a few Angular "features":

* Routes: Display different content from a templates depending of the url.
* Location: The url is updated and the back button should work.
* Resources: A custom resource has been written to create the queries towards GitHub.

 It has been inspired by the example app [GitHub Contributors](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/app/app-contributors.html) in YUI 3.5.
